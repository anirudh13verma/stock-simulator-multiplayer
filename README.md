This is a Multiplayer Stock Simulator Game built using Flutter and Python. It aims to provide sole control to the host having following salient features:
* Add stocks as per your requirement with **user-feeded stock names**
* **Increase or decrease stock prices** at any instant of any stock of your choice
* Being a **multiplayer game**, it relies on the players to be on the same local network as the host/server


## Installation Guide

* First we need to ensure that the libraries required by the server are already installed. Run the following code to install the library **requests** which helps in data transfer between server and client
```bash
pip install requests  
```
* Now pick the appropriate release as per your operating system
    * **Windows** : [windows.zip]()
    * **Linux** : [linux.zip]()
    * **Android** (without server) : [android.apk]()


## Starting Server

To use the simulator, first you need to start the server. In order to do that, find the server.py in the extracted zip location and run following command or just double-click the file:
```bash
python3 server.py
```
It will start the server and it ask you how many stocks do you want in the game
```bash
$ python3 server.py 
```
```
Enter how many stocks you want: 4
Enter Name of 1 stock: A
Enter Name of 2 stock: B
Enter Name of 3 stock: C
Enter Name of 4 stock: D
The Server's IP: 192.168.29.144
Server is listening for clients...
Enter '+' to increase stock price, '-' to decrease stock price, or 'exit' to stop:
```
Here, you can see the Server's IP which will be used later to connect to the server
